## Gap Statement (from CLAUDE.md)

> *"While Diane et al. (2025) provide a systematic review of LPWAN technologies focusing on technical characteristics, and Ahmed et al. (2025) review AI/IoT for sustainable agriculture, no existing work simultaneously addresses the comparative analysis of LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, and Sigfox with AI/ML integration specifically for precision agriculture applications using a systematic review methodology."*
