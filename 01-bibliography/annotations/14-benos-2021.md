## Keywords
> Machine learning, crop management, water management, soil management, livestock management, artificial intelligence, precision agriculture, precision livestock farming

## Research Question / Objective
> What is the state of ML applications in agriculture (2018–2020) across crop, water, soil, and livestock management, and how has the field evolved since 2018?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Systematic Review — **PRISMA guidelines**
- **Databases:** Scopus, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web of Science, MDPI
- **Papers reviewed:** **338 journal articles**
- **Date range:** 2018–2020
- **Inclusion:** Journal papers only; English; one of 4 management categories
- **Exclusion:** Conference papers, reviews, theses, non-English
- **LPWAN technology covered:** Not addressed
- **AI/ML technique:** ANN/CNN (51.8%), Ensemble Learning (22.2%), SVM (11.5%)
- **Agriculture domain:** Crop / Water / Soil / Livestock

## Key Findings

| Domain | Share | Top ML Model | Key Application |
|---|---|---|---|
| Crop management | 68% | CNN | Yield prediction (20%), Disease detection (19%), Weed detection (13%) |
| Livestock management | 12% | ANN, SVM | Cattle welfare (58.5%), Sheep (26.8%) |
| Soil management | 10% | ANN | Moisture, organic carbon prediction |
| Water management | 10% | ANN | Irrigation scheduling, ET estimation |

1. **745% increase** in ML-in-agriculture papers vs. prior review period — field is exploding.
2. ANNs dominant (51.8% of studies), CNNs leading for image-based tasks.
3. Asia leads geographic output (55% — China 24.9%, India 10.1%).
4. Top venues: *Computers and Electronics in Agriculture* (19.8%), *Remote Sensing* (11.8%), *Sensors* (6.5%).
5. Remote sensing dominant data source; in-situ IoT sensors underrepresented.

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors
> - High ICT infrastructure costs limiting farmer adoption
> - Need for more field-based (not lab/simulation) datasets
> - Requirement for user-friendly interfaces for non-ML-expert farmers
> - Computational scalability challenges on edge devices
> - No LPWAN/wireless connectivity analysis

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** III (AI/ML Techniques), IV (Methodology — PRISMA comparison), V (Applications)
- **Gap addressed:** Strong — most recent comprehensive PRISMA-based ML-in-agriculture review; **no LPWAN or IoT connectivity layer**
- **Citation priority:** High — must cite in Sections III and IV; PRISMA methodology reference

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> Covers ML algorithms in agriculture with zero wireless connectivity analysis. No LoRaWAN/NB-IoT/Sigfox. Our review fills the critical gap of connecting the LPWAN data acquisition layer to the ML analytics pipeline that this paper reviews in isolation.
