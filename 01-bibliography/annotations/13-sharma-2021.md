## Keywords
> Machine learning, precision agriculture, IoT, smart farming, computer vision, crop yield prediction, crop quality, weed detection, knowledge-based agriculture

## Research Question / Objective
> How does machine learning — combined with IoT-enabled farm machinery and computer vision — transform precision agriculture across soil, crop, livestock, irrigation, and harvesting domains?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Comprehensive systematic review
- **References reviewed:** 189 citations
- **LPWAN technology covered:** IoT connectivity mentioned (collar sensors, farm machinery) — LPWAN not specifically addressed
- **AI/ML technique:** ML broadly (SVM, ANN, CNN, RF, Decision Trees — survey across techniques)
- **Agriculture domain:** Soil / Crop / Disease & Weed / Livestock / Irrigation / Harvesting

## Key Findings

| Domain | ML Focus | Highlight |
|---|---|---|
| Soil & Crop | Organic carbon/moisture prediction; yield forecasting | IoT sensor data as ML input |
| Disease & Weed | Detection via image classification | CNN dominant |
| Livestock | Fertility pattern prediction, disorder diagnosis | Collar sensor analytics |
| Water/Irrigation | Drip irrigation intelligent control | ML-based scheduling |
| Harvesting | Automated techniques | Labor reduction |

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors
> (to fill after reading full paper)

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** III (AI/ML Techniques), V (Applications — all domains), VIII (AI-Enabled Use Cases)
- **Gap addressed:** Strong — ML + IoT + precision agriculture intersection; **no LPWAN comparative analysis** (LoRaWAN/NB-IoT/Sigfox not systematically reviewed)
- **Citation priority:** High — IEEE Access, directly relevant; cite in Section III and V

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> IoT mentioned generally (farm machinery, collar sensors) but no LPWAN technology analysis. No LoRaWAN/NB-IoT/Sigfox comparison. Our review provides the missing wireless LPWAN technology layer with systematic AI/ML performance benchmarking across all three protocols.
