## Keywords
> IoT, smart agriculture, LPWAN, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Sigfox, 4G, 5G, hybrid connectivity, cost-efficiency, network reliability

## Research Question / Objective
> What are the performance trade-offs between LPWAN (LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Sigfox) and cellular networks (4G/5G) in agricultural settings, and can hybrid LPWAN–5G architectures optimise cost and reliability?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Literature review (2020–2024) + real-world case studies
- **Dataset:** Literature + case studies (23-page paper, 2 tables, 2 figures)
- **LPWAN technology covered:** LoRaWAN / NB-IoT / Sigfox (all three ✓)
- **AI/ML technique:** Not covered — AI/ML not mentioned
- **Agriculture domain:** Smart agriculture / remote farm environments

## Key Findings
1. Hybrid LPWAN–5G models can reduce connectivity costs by up to **30%** while improving network reliability in remote agricultural settings.
2. LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, and Sigfox compared against 4G/5G on cost, coverage, and reliability dimensions.
3. Hybrid connectivity architectures proposed as optimal solution for cost-efficiency + reliability trade-off.

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** II (LPWAN Fundamentals), VI (Comparative Analysis), X (Future Directions — 5G integration)
- **Gap addressed:** Partial — LPWAN comparative analysis present but **no AI/ML**, focus is LPWAN vs 5G (not AI integration)
- **Citation priority:** High (direct competitor — cite in Introduction gap statement)

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> Framing is LPWAN vs 5G connectivity trade-offs — AI/ML is absent. Our review's core contribution is the systematic integration of AI/ML with LPWAN for precision agriculture, which this paper does not address.
