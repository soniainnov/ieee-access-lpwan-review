## Metadata
- **Year:** 2025
- **Database:** Wiley Online Library
- **Type:** Survey / Systematic Review
- **Q-rank:** (to verify on Scimago)
- **Affiliation:** Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, CEG Campus, Anna University, Chennai, India

## Keywords
> LoRaWAN, machine learning, deep learning, federated learning, IoT, LPWAN, network optimization

## Research Question / Objective
> How can machine learning, deep learning, and federated learning address the core challenges of LoRaWAN networks (scalability, energy efficiency, resource allocation, coverage, interference)?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Comprehensive survey
- **Dataset:** Literature review
- **LPWAN technology covered:** LoRaWAN only
- **AI/ML technique:** ML, deep learning, federated learning (survey of techniques)
- **Agriculture domain:** Not agriculture-specific — general IoT domains

## Key Findings
1. LoRaWAN faces challenges in scalability, energy efficiency, resource allocation, coverage, and interference — ML-based approaches address these.
2. Deep learning and federated learning introduce intelligent, adaptive solutions for LoRaWAN network management.
3. Survey synthesizes real-world implementations across various IoT domains (not agriculture-specific).

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors
> (to fill after reading full paper)

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** II (LPWAN Fundamentals), III (AI/ML Techniques), VI (Comparative Analysis)
- **Gap addressed:** Partial — covers ML+LoRaWAN but NOT agriculture-specific, NOT NB-IoT/Sigfox comparative
- **Citation priority:** High (direct competitor — must cite in Introduction gap statement)

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> Scope limited to LoRaWAN only (no NB-IoT, no Sigfox). Focus is general IoT performance optimization, not precision agriculture. No PRISMA/systematic methodology.
