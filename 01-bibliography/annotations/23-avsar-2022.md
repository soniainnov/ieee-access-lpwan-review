## Research Question / Objective
> What are the technical properties, smart agriculture application domains, and comparative strengths/weaknesses of the five most-used wireless communication protocols (ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, NB-IoT, LoRaWAN) in IoT-based precision agriculture?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Comprehensive literature review (296 references)
- **Protocols compared:** ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, NB-IoT, LoRaWAN — all three LPWAN technologies covered ✓
- **Application areas:** 6 major precision agriculture domains examined in detail
- **LPWAN technology covered:** LoRaWAN + NB-IoT + Sigfox — all three explicitly ✓ — with comparative technical analysis
- **AI/ML technique:** Not the primary focus — wireless protocol review
- **Agriculture domain:** Multi-domain precision agriculture coverage

## Key Findings
1. LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, and Sigfox all reviewed comparatively for smart agriculture — technical properties, inconsistencies across sources identified and corrected.
2. Trending protocols and applications identified by analyzing recent papers — LoRaWAN dominant in unlicensed agricultural deployments; NB-IoT strong where cellular infrastructure exists.
3. Six major smart agriculture application areas investigated: soil monitoring, crop monitoring, irrigation, livestock, greenhouse, and pest/disease detection.
4. Protocol selection criteria mapped to application requirements: range, power consumption, data rate, cost, deployment complexity, regulatory constraints.
5. Key inconsistencies in published technical specifications (duty cycles, sensitivity, range) are highlighted and reconciled — important methodological contribution.

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors
> - No AI/ML integration analysis — protocol layer only
> - No experimental performance comparison — literature-based synthesis
> - Published 2022 — does not cover most recent 2023–2025 LPWAN developments

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** II (LPWAN Fundamentals — technical comparison of LoRaWAN/NB-IoT/Sigfox/ZigBee/Wi-Fi), V (Applications — 6 agriculture domains), VI (Comparative Analysis — protocol selection criteria), IX (Challenges)
- **Gap addressed:** Strong — covers all three LPWAN technologies in agriculture context; **no AI/ML integration, no systematic PRISMA methodology, no performance benchmarking with ML workloads**
- **Citation priority:** Medium-High — comprehensive protocol comparison across 296 references; cite in Sections II and VI as protocol comparison reference

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> Protocol-layer review only — no AI/ML analysis, no federated learning, no systematic PRISMA methodology, no performance quantification with machine learning workloads. Our review adds the AI/ML integration layer that this paper explicitly omits, and applies a PRISMA-based systematic methodology.
