## Metadata
- **Year:** 2017 (arXiv preprint 2016)
- **Database:** IEEE Xplore
- **Type:** Journal — Tutorial / Primer
- **Q-rank:** Q1 (IEEE Communications Magazine — top IEEE magazine)
- **Citations:** 2,000+ — canonical NB-IoT reference paper
- **Affiliation:** Ericsson Research (all authors) — the team that standardized NB-IoT in 3GPP

## Keywords
> NB-IoT, Narrowband IoT, 3GPP Release 13, cellular IoT, LPWAN, deployment flexibility, battery life, coverage extension, massive IoT

## Research Question / Objective
> How does NB-IoT address key IoT requirements — deployment flexibility, low device complexity, long battery life, massive device support, and extended coverage — as defined in 3GPP Release 13?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Standards-based tutorial / primer (8 pages, 5 figures)
- **Dataset:** 3GPP Release 13 specifications
- **LPWAN technology covered:** NB-IoT only
- **AI/ML technique:** None
- **Agriculture domain:** Not covered

## Key Findings
1. NB-IoT supports three deployment modes: **in-band** (within LTE carriers), **guard-band** (LTE guard bands), **standalone** (dedicated spectrum, e.g., repurposed GSM).
2. Coverage extension: up to **20 dB** improvement over GPRS — enables deep indoor and underground IoT.
3. Long battery life target: **10 years** on a 5 Wh battery for typical IoT reporting rates.
4. Supports massive numbers of devices per cell through narrowband operation (200 kHz).
5. Design decisions from the Ericsson team that led 3GPP Release 13 standardization.

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors
> Condensed primer format — not exhaustive; identifies areas for future 3GPP development beyond Release 13.

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** II (LPWAN Fundamentals — NB-IoT subsection)
- **Gap addressed:** Foundational — defines NB-IoT standard; no AI/ML, no agriculture
- **Citation priority:** **Essential** — the primary NB-IoT reference; must cite in Section II

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> NB-IoT standards primer only — no comparative LPWAN analysis, no AI/ML, no agriculture applications. Serves as the primary technical reference for the NB-IoT subsection of our review.
