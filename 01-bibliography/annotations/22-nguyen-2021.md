## Research Question / Objective
> How can federated learning (FL) enable distributed, privacy-preserving AI across heterogeneous IoT systems — without requiring centralized data collection — and what are the key challenges and applications across IoT service domains?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Comprehensive literature survey
- **Scope:** FL-IoT integration across 6 major domains: smart healthcare, smart transportation, UAVs, smart cities, smart industry, and general IoT services
- **LPWAN technology covered:** Not the primary focus — IoT connectivity treated generically; LPWAN relevant as the communication layer for FL-enabled IoT nodes
- **AI/ML technique:** Federated learning — distributed collaborative training across IoT edge devices without sharing raw data
- **Agriculture domain:** Smart industry / smart city contexts — precision agriculture applicable as IoT deployment scenario

## Key Findings
1. FL enables distributed AI across IoT devices by training local models on edge nodes and aggregating model updates — raw data never leaves the device (privacy-preserving).
2. FL for IoT addresses: data sharing, offloading/caching, attack detection, localization, mobile crowdsensing, privacy & security — all relevant to agricultural IoT.
3. Communication overhead is the primary FL-IoT challenge: low-bandwidth LPWAN constrains model update frequency — critical limitation for LoRaWAN/NB-IoT deployments.
4. Heterogeneous IoT devices (varying compute, battery, connectivity) require adaptive FL aggregation strategies — directly applicable to LPWAN sensor nodes in precision agriculture.
5. FL for smart agriculture specifically identified as a high-potential application: enables collaborative training across farms without exposing proprietary field data.

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors
> - LPWAN technologies not specifically analyzed for FL communication overhead
> - Agriculture domain covered briefly — not the primary focus
> - FL convergence under intermittent LPWAN connectivity (packet loss, duty cycles) not addressed

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** III (AI/ML Techniques — Federated Learning as advanced distributed ML paradigm), IX (Challenges — privacy, communication overhead over LPWAN), X (Future Directions — FL for collaborative precision agriculture)
- **Gap addressed:** Strong — FL for IoT is directly applicable to privacy-preserving distributed AI across LPWAN agricultural sensor networks; **LPWAN-specific FL constraints (bandwidth, duty cycle) = our contribution**
- **Citation priority:** High — IEEE COMST Q1, 2,000+ citations; foundational FL+IoT reference for Section III; cite when introducing FL as an AI/ML technique for agricultural IoT

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> Comprehensive survey on FL for general IoT — no LPWAN comparative analysis (LoRaWAN/NB-IoT/Sigfox absent), no precision agriculture focus, no PRISMA methodology. Our review applies the FL paradigm this paper introduces to the specific context of LPWAN-connected agricultural sensor networks.
