## Keywords
> IoT, data analytics, machine learning, precision agriculture, smart agriculture, crop disease detection, prediction model

## Research Question / Objective
> How can IoT data analytics and machine learning be integrated to transform traditional farming into precise, data-driven precision agriculture — with application to crop disease prediction?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Systematic review + case study (apple disease detection, Kashmir valley orchards)
- **Approach:** Local farmer survey on technology adoption + ML prediction model development
- **LPWAN technology covered:** Not covered — IoT connectivity treated generally
- **AI/ML technique:** ML for crop disease prediction (specific algorithms to verify in full paper)
- **Agriculture domain:** Crop disease detection / Precision agriculture (orchard focus)

## Key Findings
1. IoT + ML integration creates a data-driven precision agriculture pipeline — moving from statistical to quantitative decision-making.
2. Case study: ML-based prediction model for apple disease detection in Kashmir valley orchards — demonstrates real-world deployment context.
3. Local farmer survey reveals adoption barriers: technology literacy, infrastructure cost, connectivity.
4. Identifies challenges of incorporating emerging technologies into traditional farming practices.

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors
> - No LPWAN/wireless connectivity analysis — IoT connectivity not systematically addressed
> - Case study limited to one crop type (apple) in one region (Kashmir valley)
> - Specific ML algorithm performance metrics to verify in full paper

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** III (AI/ML Techniques — disease detection), V (Applications — crop management), VIII (AI Use Cases), IX (Challenges — adoption barriers)
- **Gap addressed:** Partial — IoT + ML + precision agriculture; **no LPWAN technology layer**
- **Citation priority:** Medium-High — published in King Saud University journal (regional relevance for KFU context); cite in Section V

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> Focuses on IoT data analytics + ML for crop disease in a regional case study — no LPWAN comparative analysis (LoRaWAN/NB-IoT/Sigfox absent). Our review provides the wireless LPWAN infrastructure layer that feeds the ML pipeline this paper studies.
