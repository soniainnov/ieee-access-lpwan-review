## Keywords
> LPWAN, Sigfox, LoRa, NB-IoT, IoT, large-scale deployment, battery lifetime, capacity, cost, latency, QoS

## Research Question / Objective
> Which LPWAN technology (Sigfox, LoRa, NB-IoT) is best suited for large-scale IoT deployment across different application scenarios?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Comparative analytical study
- **Dataset:** Technical specifications + application scenario analysis
- **LPWAN technology covered:** Sigfox / LoRa / NB-IoT (all three ✓)
- **AI/ML technique:** None
- **Agriculture domain:** Not agriculture-specific — general IoT deployment

## Key Findings
1. **Sigfox and LoRa** outperform NB-IoT in battery lifetime, network capacity, and deployment cost.
2. **NB-IoT** outperforms Sigfox and LoRa in latency and Quality of Service (QoS).
3. Best-fit technology depends on the application scenario (low-latency vs. long battery life vs. cost).
4. Framework proposed to select the optimal LPWAN technology per use case.

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors
> (to fill after reading full paper)

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** II (LPWAN Fundamentals), VI (Comparative Performance Analysis)
- **Gap addressed:** Foundational — establishes baseline LPWAN comparison framework; no AI/ML, no agriculture
- **Citation priority:** **Essential** — must cite; most referenced LPWAN comparison paper

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> Published 2019 — predates the AI/ML + precision agriculture integration era. General IoT focus, no agricultural context. Our review extends this foundational work by adding AI/ML integration and precision agriculture application analysis.
