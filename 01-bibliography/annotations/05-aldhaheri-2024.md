## Metadata
- **Year:** 2024 (submitted Sep. 17) / 2025 (published IEEE IoT J.)
- **Database:** IEEE Xplore
- **Type:** Journal — Comprehensive Review
- **Q-rank:** Q1 (IEEE Internet of Things Journal — top IoT venue)
- **Affiliation:** Dept. of Electrical and Communication Engineering, United Arab Emirates University (UAEU)

## Keywords
> Agriculture IoT, channel modeling, long range (LoRa), relaying, routing, smart farming

## Research Question / Objective
> What are the opportunities, challenges, and future directions of LoRa technology as a key enabler of long-range wireless communication for agricultural IoT systems?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Comprehensive literature review
- **Dataset:** Literature
- **LPWAN technology covered:** LoRa / LoRaWAN **only** (comparative analysis with other wireless technologies included, but NB-IoT and Sigfox not systematically reviewed)
- **AI/ML technique:** On-device AI models mentioned as **future direction only** — not reviewed
- **Agriculture domain:** Smart farming / Agriculture 4.0 — general

## Key Findings
1. LoRa addresses long-range, low-power requirements for agricultural IoT across network architecture, physical layer, and channel modeling.
2. Channel modeling must account for soil properties; relay/routing mechanisms needed for vast farming areas.
3. Future directions include: advanced channel modeling, relay routing algorithms, hyperspectral imaging, drone-based sensing, and on-device AI models.
4. Comparative analysis of LoRa against other wireless technologies (WiFi, Zigbee, etc.) provided.

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors
> (to fill after reading full paper)

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** II (LPWAN Fundamentals — LoRa), V (Applications), VII (Case Studies), X (Future Directions)
- **Gap addressed:** Partial — strong LoRa+Agriculture review but **no NB-IoT/Sigfox comparison**, **no AI/ML systematic review**
- **Citation priority:** High (direct competitor, Q1 IEEE — must cite in Introduction)

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> LoRa/LoRaWAN only — no NB-IoT, no Sigfox comparative analysis. AI/ML only mentioned as a future direction, not systematically reviewed. Our review covers all three LPWAN technologies with integrated AI/ML analysis using PRISMA methodology.
