## Metadata
- **Year:** 2025
- **Database:** ScienceDirect (Elsevier) — Open Access
- **Type:** Review
- **Q-rank:** (to verify — Smart Agricultural Technology, Elsevier)
- **Affiliation:** Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, St. Louis, USA

## Keywords
> IoT, Big Data, AI, machine learning, carbon footprint, climate change, food security, sustainable agriculture, Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA)

## Research Question / Objective
> How can IoT, Big Data, and AI technologies be integrated to monitor and mitigate agricultural carbon emissions and enhance Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA)?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Review (narrative/comprehensive)
- **Dataset:** Literature
- **LPWAN technology covered:** General IoT (WiFi, LPWAN, LoRa, Bluetooth mentioned superficially — no comparative LPWAN analysis)
- **AI/ML technique:** Machine learning, predictive modeling (reviewed broadly)
- **Agriculture domain:** Sustainable agriculture / Climate-Smart Agriculture / carbon footprint

## Key Findings
1. Proposes an end-to-end system architecture combining IoT sensing, Big Data analytics, and AI/ML for carbon footprint assessment in agriculture.
2. IoT + AI combination supports sustainability objectives: resource efficiency, emissions monitoring, food security.
3. LPWAN technologies (LoRa, etc.) mentioned as connectivity options but **not systematically compared**.

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors
> (to fill after reading full paper)

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** III (AI/ML Techniques), V (Applications), IX (Challenges)
- **Gap addressed:** Partial — AI+Agriculture present but **no LoRaWAN/NB-IoT/Sigfox comparative analysis**, no PRISMA methodology
- **Citation priority:** High (direct competitor — cite in Introduction gap statement)

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> Focuses on IoT+AI for carbon footprint / Climate-Smart Agriculture — no systematic comparative analysis of LoRaWAN vs NB-IoT vs Sigfox. LPWAN mentioned only superficially. No precision agriculture ML performance benchmarks.
