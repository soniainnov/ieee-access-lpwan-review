## Keywords
> Machine learning, crop management, water management, soil management, livestock management, artificial intelligence, precision agriculture, digital agriculture

## Research Question / Objective
> What ML techniques are applied in agricultural production systems (crop, livestock, water, soil management) and what are their performance levels?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Comprehensive literature review
- **Databases:** Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed
- **Date range:** 2004–2018
- **Papers analyzed:** 40 journal articles (conferences excluded)
- **LPWAN technology covered:** Not addressed
- **AI/ML technique:** ANN, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, CNN (survey across techniques)
- **Agriculture domain:** Crop / Livestock / Water / Soil management

## Key Findings

| Category | Share | Focus | Best ML Models | Top Accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Crop management | 60% | Yield prediction, disease/weed detection, quality, species recognition | ANN, SVM | 97–100% (disease detection) |
| Livestock management | 20% | Animal welfare, production optimization | SVM, ANN | 94–96% (behavior classification) |
| Water management | 10% | Evapotranspiration, dew point prediction | ANN | — |
| Soil management | 10% | Moisture, temperature, organic carbon prediction | ANN, SVM | — |

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors
> - No LPWAN/IoT connectivity discussion
> - Individual ML approaches not integrated into full decision-making systems
> - Limited real-time deployment infrastructure assessment
> - Review window ends at 2018 — does not capture deep learning explosion

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** III (AI/ML Techniques), V (Applications — all domains)
- **Gap addressed:** Foundational ML-in-agriculture reference — no LPWAN/IoT connectivity layer, no wireless technology analysis
- **Citation priority:** **Essential** — must cite in Section III; defines the ML application landscape our review builds on

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> Reviews ML techniques in agriculture with no IoT connectivity or LPWAN dimension whatsoever. Our review adds the wireless LPWAN layer (LoRaWAN/NB-IoT/Sigfox) to the AI/ML-agriculture intersection, which this paper does not address.
