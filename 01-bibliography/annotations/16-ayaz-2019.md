## Keywords

## Research Question / Objective
> How can IoT devices and wireless communication technologies — including LPWAN — transform agriculture from statistical to quantitative data-driven approaches across the full crop lifecycle?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Comprehensive survey
- **Scope:** IoT devices and communication techniques for agriculture from planting through harvest
- **LPWAN technology covered:** LoRa / Sigfox / NB-IoT explicitly covered ✓
- **AI/ML technique:** Mentioned superficially — not the primary focus
- **Agriculture domain:** Soil / Crop / Irrigation / Pest & insect detection / UAV crop surveillance / Yield optimization

## Key Findings
1. IoT wireless communication for agriculture surveyed across: WPAN (ZigBee, BLE), WLAN (Wi-Fi), **LPWAN (LoRa, Sigfox, NB-IoT)**, and cellular networks.
2. LPWAN identified as optimal for large-scale field deployments requiring long range and low power.
3. Sensors mapped to specific agriculture applications: soil preparation, crop monitoring, irrigation control, pest detection.
4. UAVs integrated with IoT for aerial crop surveillance and yield estimation.
5. Challenges identified: energy harvesting, data security, interoperability, cost of deployment.

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors
> - AI/ML analytics not systematically reviewed
> - No performance benchmarking across LPWAN technologies
> - No comparative analysis of LoRaWAN vs NB-IoT vs Sigfox for specific agri use cases

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** II (LPWAN — communication role), V (Applications — all domains), VII (Case Studies), IX (Challenges)
- **Gap addressed:** Strong — covers IoT + LPWAN + agriculture; **no AI/ML integration analysis, no LPWAN performance comparison**
- **Citation priority:** High — IEEE Access Q1, Saudi affiliation, 1,000+ citations; cite in Sections II and V

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> Surveys IoT devices and wireless connectivity for agriculture but does not systematically compare AI/ML performance across LPWAN technologies. Published in the same journal (IEEE Access) — useful as format reference. Our review adds the missing AI/ML integration layer with PRISMA-based systematic methodology.
