## Metadata
- **Year:** 2025
- **Database:** Springer (Open Access)
- **Type:** Systematic Review
- **Q-rank:** (to verify on Scimago — Discover IoT is a Springer journal)

## Keywords
> LPWAN, LoRa, Sigfox, NB-IoT, IoT, low power, long range, energy efficiency, scalability

## Research Question / Objective
> How do LPWAN technologies (LoRa, Sigfox, NB-IoT) achieve the trade-off between long transmission range and low power consumption? What are their characteristics, architectures, applications, and open challenges?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Systematic and comprehensive review
- **Databases searched:** Springer, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar
- **Inclusion/Exclusion criteria:** (to fill after reading)
- **Number of papers reviewed:** (to fill after reading)
- **LPWAN technology covered:** LoRa / Sigfox / NB-IoT
- **AI/ML technique:** None
- **Agriculture domain:** None — general LPWAN applications

## Key Findings
1. Develops LPWAN characteristics and techniques for long-range energy efficiency, high scalability, and low cost.
2. Presents application areas with use-case network architectures (not agriculture-specific).
3. Covers standards from IEEE, ETSI, and 3GPP alongside LoRa, Sigfox, NB-IoT descriptions.
4. Addresses open research challenges in spectrum and energy optimization.

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors
> (to fill after reading full paper)

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** II (LPWAN Fundamentals), IV (Methodology — PRISMA comparison), IX (Challenges)
- **Gap addressed:** Partial — comprehensive LPWAN technical review but **no AI/ML**, **no precision agriculture focus**
- **Citation priority:** High (direct competitor — cite in Introduction gap statement)

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> Pure LPWAN technical review — no AI/ML integration whatsoever. No agriculture focus. Our review adds the AI/ML + precision agriculture systematic dimension missing here.
