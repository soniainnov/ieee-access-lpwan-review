## Research Question / Objective
> What is the emerging class of Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies operating in unlicensed sub-GHz bands, and how do they compare for IoT and smart city connectivity?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Overview / comparative tutorial
- **Dataset:** Technical specifications and literature
- **LPWAN technology covered:** LoRa / Sigfox / Ingenu (RPMA) / Cellular IoT — broad coverage
- **AI/ML technique:** None
- **Agriculture domain:** Not covered — IoT and smart city focus

## Key Findings
1. LPWANs fill a gap between short-range mesh networks and long-range legacy cellular — enabling low-rate, star-topology IoT at scale.
2. Sub-GHz unlicensed bands (ISM) provide long-range propagation; key trade-off is low data rate.
3. Sigfox: ultra-narrowband (100 Hz), simple protocol, operator-managed network — best for ultra-low-power uplink-heavy applications.
4. LoRa: chirp spread spectrum, adaptive data rate, unlicensed deployment — flexible and open ecosystem.
5. Provides one of the earliest systematic comparisons of LPWAN technologies in a peer-reviewed venue.

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** II (LPWAN Fundamentals — Sigfox subsection, technology landscape)
- **Gap addressed:** Foundational — earliest IEEE overview of the LPWAN landscape including Sigfox; no AI/ML, no agriculture
- **Citation priority:** **Essential** — seminal paper that defined the LPWAN field; must cite in Section II

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> Published 2016 — pre-AI/ML integration era. Smart city focus, no agriculture. Serves as the foundational Sigfox + LPWAN landscape reference for Section II of our review, complementing Raza (2017) and Mekki (2019).
