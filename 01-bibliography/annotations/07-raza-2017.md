## Keywords
> LPWA, LPWAN, IoT, M2M, wide-area connectivity, low power, LoRa, Sigfox, NB-IoT, Weightless, coverage, data rate

## Research Question / Objective
> What design goals and techniques do LPWA technologies use to offer wide-area coverage to low-power devices, and what are the limitations and future research directions?

## Methodology
- **Study type:** Comprehensive survey / overview
- **Dataset:** Technical standards + literature analysis
- **LPWAN technology covered:** LoRa / Sigfox / NB-IoT / Weightless / DASH7 / IEEE 802.11ah (broad coverage)
- **AI/ML technique:** None
- **Agriculture domain:** Not agriculture-specific — general IoT/M2M/smart city

## Key Findings
1. All LPWA technologies share similar design approaches — exploit sub-GHz ISM bands, star topology, simple MAC protocols — and thus share similar limitations.
2. Trade-off is inherent: wide area + low power = low data rates; no technology escapes this triangle.
3. Standards landscape includes IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI bodies alongside proprietary consortia (LoRa Alliance, Weightless-SIG, Dash7).
4. Identifies open research challenges: scalability, interference, roaming, security, QoS.

## Limitations Acknowledged by Authors
> (to fill after reading full paper)

## Relevance to Our Review
- **Section(s) covered:** II (LPWAN Fundamentals — architecture, design goals), IX (Challenges)
- **Gap addressed:** Foundational — defines the LPWA design space; no AI/ML, no agriculture
- **Citation priority:** **Essential** — seminal paper, must cite in Section II

## Why It Is NOT a Competitor
> Published 2017 — predates the AI/ML integration era. Covers LPWAN broadly without precision agriculture or ML lens. Serves as a foundational reference for Section II of our review.
